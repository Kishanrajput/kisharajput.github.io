title: (Invited Lecture) Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning for Particle Accelerators

event: 5th ICFA Beam Dynamics Mini-Workshop on Applications of Machine Learning in Particle Accelerators
event_url: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1382428/

location: European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva, Switzerland
address:
  street: CERN
  city: Geneva
  country: Switzerland

summary: Invited lecture on multi-objective reinforcement learning techniques applied to particle accelerator optimization and control.
abstract: "This lecture covers advanced techniques in multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) for simultaneous optimization of multiple competing objectives in particle accelerators. We will discuss how to handle trade-offs between objectives, leverage gradient-based simulations for improved learning, and deploy these methods in real-world accelerator environments."

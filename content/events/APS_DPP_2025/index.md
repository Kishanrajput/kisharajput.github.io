summary: Talk on developing robust adaptive digital twins with uncertainty awareness for fusion science applications.
abstract: "Developing accurate and robust digital twins for fusion plasma control is essential for advancing fusion energy research. We present methods for creating adaptive digital twins that can handle non-stationary data and provide uncertainty estimates. This work demonstrates how advanced machine learning techniques can improve model predictions in the face of changing accelerator conditions and plasma dynamics."

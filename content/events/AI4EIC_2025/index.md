summary: Explainable and Differential Reinforcement Learning for Multi-objective Optimization in Particle Accelerators
abstract: "This talk presents recent advancements in applying explainable and differential reinforcement learning techniques for multi-objective optimization in particle accelerators. We will discuss how differential simulations combined with RL can handle conflicting optimization objectives, and how explainability methods help understand the decision-making process of RL agents."

abstract: "Hydra is an advanced framework designed for training and managing AI models for near real time data quality monitoring at Jefferson Lab. Deployed in all four experimental halls, Hydra has analyzed over 2 million images and has extended its capabilities to offline monitoring and validation. This paper describes the Hydra framework, its user interface and experience, and the challenges inherent in its design and deployment, including containerization for portable deployment."
